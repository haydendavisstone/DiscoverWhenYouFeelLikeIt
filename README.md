# Spotify Discover Weekly History

I was annoyed when I missed my weekly songs generated by Spotify so I created this script.

The script uses the Spotipy API to copy songs from the Discover Weekly and Release Radar lists and adds them to a seperate playlist.
If the playlist already exists, any new songs will be added to the list and any existing songs will be skipped.


## Setup

To generate a client id and secret, sign in to [Spotify for Developers](https://developer.spotify.com) and create an app on the [dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) page.<br>
When creating an app, set 'Redirect URI' to http://localhost:8080/callback<br> App name and description can be whatever.

Client id and secret can be found in the 'settings' of the created app. Your username can be found on your Spotify account overview.<br>

These 3 parameters will need to be added to the script, example:<br>

```
USERNAME = '8aa82gysa66hk5q7ofgriy9it'
CLIENT_ID = 'hhe64jiif9434d8894fb44499af6962f'
CLIENT_SECRET = 'j65ed093824343cd9e8c4561b902b1b5'
```

I have the script set to run on start up. This can be done on Windows by adding the script to your Startup folder (**Win+R and enter 'shell:startup'**). If you do this, you may need to change your options to always open the file with Python and not another app.
