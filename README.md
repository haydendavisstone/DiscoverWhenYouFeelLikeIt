I was annoyed when I missed my weekly songs generated by Spotify so I created this script.

The script uses the Spotipy API to copy songs from the Discover Weekly and Release Radar lists and adds them to a seperate playlist.
If the playlist already exists, any new songs will be added to the list and any existing songs will be skipped.

I have the script set to run on start up. This can be done on Windows by adding the script to your Startup folder(Win+R and enter 'shell:startup').

# Setup

To generate a client id and secret, create an app on the [dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) page.<br>
When creating an app, set 'Redirect URI' to http://localhost:8888/callback, app name and description can be whatever.<br>

Client id and secret can be found in the 'settings' of the created app. Your username can be found on your Spotify account overview.<br>

These 3 parameters will need to be added to the script, example:<br>

USERNAME = '8aa82gysa66hk5q7ofgriy9it'<br>
CLIENT_ID = 'hhe64jiif9434d8894fb44499af6962f'<br>
CLIENT_SECRET = 'j65ed093824343cd9e8c4561b902b1b5'<br>
