I was annoyed when I missed my weekly songs generated by Spotify so I created this script.

The script uses the Spotipy API to copy songs from the Discover Weekly and Release Radar lists and adds them to a seperate playlist.
If the playlist already exists, any new songs will be added and any existing songs will be skipped.

I have the script set to run on pc startup.
